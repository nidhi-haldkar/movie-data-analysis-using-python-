# 🎬 **Movie Data Analysis Project**

## 📑 **Project Overview**
This project involves an in-depth analysis of a movie dataset containing over 10,800 records with various attributes such as movie titles, budgets, revenues, genres, production companies, and more. The primary goal was to uncover valuable insights about the movie industry's trends, performance metrics, and profitability using Python.

## 🗂️ **Dataset**
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- `popularity`
- `budget`
- `revenue`
- `profit`
- `ROI` (Return on Investment)
- `original_title`
- `director`
- `keywords`
- `runtime`
- `genres`
- `production_companies`
- `release_date`
- `vote_count`
- `vote_average`
- `release_year`
- `revenue_adj`

## 🎯 **Objectives**
The analysis aimed to answer the following questions:
- Which movies generated the highest revenue and ROI?
- What are the most profitable genres and production companies?
- How do budget and revenue trends vary over the years?
- What correlations exist between different movie attributes like budget, revenue, and popularity?

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 **Analysis & Visualizations**
The project involved the following key analyses and visualizations:
1. **Top 5 Movies by Revenue:** Identified the highest-grossing movies.
2. **Revenue by Genre:** Analyzed revenue distribution across different genres.
3. **Top Production Companies by Profit:** Evaluated production companies with the highest profits.
4. **Budget vs. Revenue Analysis:** Examined the relationship between movie budgets and their revenues.
5. **Correlation Matrix:** Analyzed the correlation between numerical variables like popularity, budget, revenue, and ROI.
6. **Genre Distribution:** Visualized the distribution of movies across different genres.
7. **Trend Analysis:** Explored budget and revenue trends over the years.

## 🔍 **Key Findings & Insights**
- **Top Revenue Generating Movies:** Movies like *Avatar*, *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, and *Titanic* topped the list for the highest revenue.
- **Most Lucrative Genres:** Action and Adventure emerged as the most profitable genres, with a total revenue of over **$170 billion** each.
- **Top Production Companies:** Warner Bros. and Universal Pictures led the industry in terms of profit generation.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Revenue showed a strong positive correlation with budget and vote count, indicating that higher budgets and popularity often lead to greater revenue.
